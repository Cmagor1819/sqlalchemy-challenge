# Objective:

### Part 1:

This section's purpose is to use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This section is reflecting the tables of the database into SQLAlchemy ORM and then performing an exploratory precipiation and station analysis. 

# Exploratory Precipitation Analysis:

This section is finding the most recent date in the data set, desinging a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation and plotting the results with Matplotlib.

# Exploratory Station Analysis

This section is designing queries to calculate the total number of stations, finding the most active stations, and calculating the lowest, highest, and average temperatures. We then take that info and query the last 12 months of temp observation data and plot it on a histogram. Finalized this part by making sure to close out of the session.
